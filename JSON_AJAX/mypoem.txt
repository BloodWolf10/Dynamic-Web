I wonder why the grass is green,
A mystery of nature, unseen.
 
Is it the sun's gentle touch,
Or the earth's secret clutch?
 
A hue so vibrant and serene,
In every meadow, it's seen.
 
Perhaps a gift from the divine,
A color that will forever shine.
 
The grass whispers its tale,
In the wind, it will prevail.
 
A simple beauty, so serene,
I wonder why the grass is green.
